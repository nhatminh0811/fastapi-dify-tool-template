    - Documents are preprocessed into smaller text chunks.
    - These chunks are embedded into vector representations and stored in a vector
    - User queries are embedded using the same method as the text chunks.
    - The system identifies the most relevant chunks using similarity measures (e.g.,
    - The selected text chunks are passed to a generative language model (e.g., LLM).
    - The model creates a response by integrating the retrieved information into a
