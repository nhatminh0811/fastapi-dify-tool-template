  - II. Detail Instructions
    - Introduction to RAG
      - Hybrid AI approach combining retrieval-based methods with generative language models.
      - Retrieves relevant documents and synthesizes coherent responses.
      - Applied in question-answering, chatbots, and decision-making platforms.
      - Key Features:
        - Combines accuracy of retrieval with creativity of generative AI.
        - Reduces hallucination by grounding responses in real data.
        - Scales efficiently with increasing data complexity.
    - RAG Pipeline Overview
      - Data Indexing:
        - Documents preprocessed into smaller text chunks.
        - Chunks embedded into vector representations and stored in a vector database.
      - Data Retrieval:
        - User queries embedded using the same method.
        - System identifies most relevant chunks using similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity).
      - Response Generation:
        - Selected chunks passed to a generative language model (e.g., LLM).
        - Model creates a response by integrating the retrieved information.
    - Advantages and Challenges of RAG
      - Advantages:
        - Efficient Information Retrieval
        - Contextual and Accurate Responses
        - Minimized Hallucination
      - Challenges:
        - Dependence on Data Quality
        - Computational Costs
        - Complexity in Deployment
    - Dify and Its Role in AI
      - Robust platform simplifying deployment and management of AI tools like RAG.
      - Enhances real-time interaction between retrievers, generators, and end-users.
      - Key Features:
        - Simplified Deployment
        - Enhanced Flexibility
        - Real-Time Processing
      - Streamlines connection between database retrieval, LLM-based generation, and UI design.
    - Conclusion and Recommendations
      - RAG and Dify offer a powerful framework for efficient and accurate information retrieval and AI-powered generation.
      - Recommendations:
        - Invest in high-quality data indexing and retrieval systems.
        - Optimize computational resources.
        - Continuously refine and test integrations.


- Bảng theo dõi nội dung sửa đổi tài liệu (Table for tracking document revisions -  This would require a table format which is not ideally represented in a mindmap.  This should be a separate document or section.)

- Phê duyệt, Soạn thảo, Kiểm tra (Approval, Drafting, Checking -  These are administrative details and don't fit well into the mindmap structure. They should be placed separately.)
